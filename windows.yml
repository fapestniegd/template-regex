# Here is where we put the regular expressions for repeated tokens
# I have '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' for an IP address, 
# and just \S+ for others, but you can make them as specific or generic as you
# like, these will be pasted in via Template::Toolkit where ever the [% IP %]
# tag is found in the log templates, this makes what would be an impossible to
# manage regular expression a managable string
# Do not use parenthesis to return $1, $2, $3, etc in these or it will break
# the module, as it does this for you based on [% TAGS %]

# Here we have nested log substrings and their names, the logic being that 
# you can match the first part of a line, and then iterate to match the 
# remainder of the line. What you should get out of the function is the 
# dot-delimited name of the path it took
# ( e.g. cisco_asa.ipsec_message.constr_blank_hash ) a list of patterns matched
# by each of the (expanded) templates
# since cisco_ass.local_host_teardown "expands" to:
# '[% DATE %]T[% TIME %][% TZ_OFF %] [% HOSTNAME %] [% ASA_CODE %] Teardown local-host [% IFACE_IP %] duration [% DURATION %]'
# There would be a list of 7 elements of the 7 patterns matched by [% TAGS %]
# if you need finer resolution into the tag, break it out into smaller tags
# ( e.g. [% IP %] can become [% INT %]\.[% INT %]\.[% INT %]\.[% INT %] )
#
# The reaoning behind this is that you can triggre a function on cisco_asa.local_host_buildup,
# and pass it the list of 6 patterns that matched as arguments
